## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
   The five major components of a database are:
   1. Hardware - refers to the physical, electronic devices such as computers and hard disks that offer the interface between computers and real-world systems.
   2. Software - is a set of programs used to manage and control the database and includes the database software, operating system, network software used to share the data with other users, and the applications used to access the data.
   3. Data - are raw facts and information that need to be organized and processed to make it more meaningful. Database dictionaries are used to centralize, document, control, and coordinate the use of data within an organization. A database is a repository of information about a database (also called metadata).
   4. Procedures - refer to the instructions used in a database management system and encompass everything from instructions to setup and install, login and logout, manage the day-to-day operations, take backups of data, and generate reports.
   5. Database Access Language - is a language used to write commands to access, update, and delete data stored in a database. Users can write commands using Database Access Language before submitting them to the database for execution. Through utilizing the language, users can create new databases, tables, insert data, and delete data.
   
2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
   A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in tables. These tables consist of rows (records) and columns (fields), and relationships can be established between different tables using keys. Examples are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
   1. Data Definition Language (DDL) 
   DDL statements are used to define, modify, and delete the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, indexes, and views.
   
   2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
   DML statements are used to manipulate data stored in database objects (e.g., inserting, updating, and deleting data).
   
   3. Data Control Language (DCL)
   DCL statements are used to control access to the database by granting or revoking permissions.

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
   A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a table while A Foreign Key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that establishes a relationship with the Primary Key in another table. 

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
   An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities (objects) within a database and the relationships between those entities.

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
   Data Integrity - Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
   Flexibility and Scalability - Easy to modify and supports growth.
   Ease of Use - Standardized and user-friendly SQL for interaction.
   Relationships Between Data - Links related data efficiently.
   Data Security - Provides robust access control and encryption.
   Concurrent Access - Allows simultaneous use by multiple users.
   ACID Compliance - Ensures reliable and consistent transactions.
   Data Redundancy Minimization - Reduces duplication through normalization.
   Advanced Querying and Reporting - Enables complex data analysis.
   Wide Adoption and Tool Support - Supported by numerous systems and platforms.
   Backup and Recovery - Ensures data safety during failures.
   Standardization - Ensures compatibility across different systems.

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
   Numeric Data Types - Used to store numbers, both integers and floating-point values.
   Character/String Data Types - Used to store text or alphanumeric data.
   Date and Time Data Types - Used to store dates, times, or both.
   Boolean Data Type - Used to store logical values.

8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?
   Data Storage and Retrieval - Stores data efficiently and retrieves it using queries.
   Security - Protects data from unauthorized access.
   Data Integrity - Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
   Redundancy Minimization - Reduces duplicate data and improves efficiency.
   Backup and Recovery - Safeguards data against loss or corruption.
   Multi-User Access - Supports concurrent access by multiple users.
   Complex Query Support - Enables advanced data analysis and reporting.
   Scalability - Handles growing data and user demands.
   Relationship Management	- Links related data in different tables.
   Simplified Development - Eases application development by abstracting data management.
